Well I've been waiting here for hours. 
It's getting cold, position closed.
A new direction, a new dawn. 
Consider this my informal complaint.
I hope you felt cheated at home with all your lies.
How long has it taken for you to look so fine.
Don't waste your life.
Just go outside.
Well I've been waiting to forget how the pieces all fell away.
You left your hometown where you grew up.
I hadn't noticed how your accent had changed.
Tell me, did these lonely hands rob your time?
And when was the signal divorced from the sign?
Illumination and accusation.
I'd like to meet her but she won't see me.
You know that I would love to see you next year.
I hope that I am still alive next year.
You magnify the way I think about myself.
Before you came I rarely thought about myself.
Behind your veil I found the body underneath.
Inside your head were things I'd never thought about.
What's my view? Well, how am I supposed to know?
Write a review? Well, how objective can I be?
You know that I would love to see you in that dress.
I hope that I will live to see you undress.
The everyday is part of what consumes me.
The hate I feel is part of what fuels me.
I testify to having guilty feelings.
I must confess, I'd like to be caught stealing.
You know that I would love to see you in that dress.
I hope that I will live to see you undress.
What's my view? Well, how am I supposed to know?
Write a review? Well, how objective can I be?
I like to wait to see how things turn out if you apply some pressure.
I like to wait to see how things turn out if you apply some pressure.
What happens when you lose everything?
You just start again.
You start all over again.

I hope that I will live to see you undress.
That’s enough, I can’t take anymore.
I’m right out of vision, I’m right out of hope.
You stood me up, just knock me down.
What’s on your conscience? Nothing happens in my town.
I’ll do graffiti if you sing to me in French.
What are we doing here if romance isn’t dead?
Mind your mouth as you walk with me.
Take care as you cross the street.
Well that’s enough, I’ve had it up to here.
I’ve lost my vision, I’ve lost my hope.
You woke me up, just hand me down.
You’ve lost your conscience, 'cause nothing happens in my town.
I’ll do graffiti if you sing to me in French.
What are we doing here if romance isn’t dead?
Stay in line on the foreign trip.
Waking up and I need a lift.
I’ll do graffiti if you sing to me in French.

Stay in line on the foreign trip.
Waking up and I need a lift and that’s enough.
I'm losing more than I'll ever have.
I'm losing more than I'll ever give.
I'm losing more than I'll ever have.
I'm losing more than I'll ever give to you.
Picture me with you, you couldn't do it.
Everything I said was true but I couldn't prove it.
Your eyes are so big when they're so close.
Why can't we say goodbye in public?
Your eyes are so big when they're so close.
Why can't we say goodbye in public?
Picture me with you, you couldn't do it.
Everything I said was true but I couldn't prove it.
And I'll admit that there's a web but it wasn't me who spun it.
Now I've made my bed but you wouldn't lie down in it.
I wrote my feelings down in a rush, I didn't even check the spelling.
Enclosed a postcard of a painting.
You are just another thing that I've yet to fathom.
You are just another thing that I've yet to fathom.
And I'm losing more than I'll ever have.
And I'm losing more than I'll ever give to you.
Picture me with you, you couldn't do it.
Everything I said was true but I couldn't prove it.
And I'll admit that there's a web but it wasn't me who spun it.
Now I've made my bed but you wouldn't lie down in it.
I sleep with my hands across my chest and I dream of you with someone else.
I feed my body with things that I don't need until I sink to the bottom.
Don't act like it came as a surprise.
Don't believe me? Then look into these eyes.
This can't go on so I should just regret it.
And even though I led you on forget it.
I'm going missing for a while.
I've got nothing left to lose.
I don't listen to anything.
I still remember how you moved and I taste your scent upon my lips.
How it started, I will never know.
But now I've reached my limit.
This can't go on so I should just regret it.
And even though I led you on forget it.
I'm going missing for a while.
I've got nothing left to lose.
I don't listen to anything.
I'm going missing for a while.
I've got nothing left to lose.
I don't listen to anything.
Do you ever want to wear your body out until there's nothing left to take?
The rain began to push you away.
Has midnight come too soon again?
I'm going missing for a while.
I've got nothing left to lose.
I don't listen to anything.
I've got nothing in defence.
I've got nothing left to lose.
I don't listen to anything.
I sleep with my hands across my chest and I dream of you with someone else.
I rewrite my life, beneath moonlight.
Please hold me now, till my breath runs out.
There are many things that I am not but there's one thing that I can't deny.
A double bluff, you fed me lines.
The shortest cut, you're searching for.
A mesh of tones surround your eyes.
I wish I knew how it came to this.
I always said you could rely on me, now it seems that I was wrong.
I want you to stay.
I want you to stay with me.
‘Cause nothing works ‘round here, where cranes collect the sky.
I long for the neon signs of night.
‘Cause nothing works ‘round here.
You know the way I feel.
Can you remember what we had.
Why do you think I overtake?
I speak to you, and you don't say no.
A camera runs just to collect.
I wish I knew how it came to this.
The lies we tell are found on film
And you start to push your lips to mine.
Outside my room you closed your eyes.
And in the end it came to this.
I always said you could rely on me.
Now it seems that I was wrong.
I want you to stay.
I want you to stay with me.
‘Cause nothing works ‘round here where cranes collect the sky.
I think of your face at night.
‘Cause nothing works ‘round here.
You know the way I feel.
Can you remember what we had?
As time gets more compressed.
You're always my reminder.
A lifetime disappears.
Can you remember what we had?
As time gets more compressed.
You are always my reminder.
You are always my reminder.
You know the way I feel.
You know the way I feel.
Thinking clearly never came as easy as it did for you.
Driving this route out of town I wish you were still around.
In the dead of night I always wondered whether you were true.
Someone better than myself an offer you just can't turn down.
A morning flight, A wasted night.
You crept back to your room.
Run along back to your new man.
Hold on, I couldn't trap you.
We're gonna head for new horizons.
When it's all good, keep things close at hand.
I could never bear to hear you struggling against the tide.
Promises I couldn't keep.
I couldn't admit I was in too deep.
Saw the lights on in your window even though you said you'd gone.
The darker nights have come again, quicker than the year before.
A morning flight, a wasted night.
You slinked back to your room.
You better run along, back to your new man.
Hold on, I could never trap you.
We're gonna head for new horizons.
When it's all good keep things close at hand.
And when it's all good you've got to keep things close at hand.
I've met so many people who look the same.
Most were forgotten but you still remain.
Most of the time, I don't care but London's so far away when you are there.
And so it saddens me to say I'm only happy when I move away.
I am young and I am lost.
Every sentence has its cost.
I am young and I am lost.
You react to my riposte.
And we look out upon the sea.
We look out upon the sea.
The coast is always changing.
I'll bring my camera out to sea.
The coast is always changing.
Age makes no difference 'til you open your mouth.
Use your time just to work things out.
I know that you can't understand when I tell you that this wasn't planned.
And so it saddens me to say I'm only happy when I move away.
I am young and I am lost.
Every sentence has its cost.
I am young and I am lost.
You react to my riposte.
And we look out upon the sea.
We look out upon the sea.
The coast is always changing.
We'll take the train out to the sea.
My heart is always changing.
It won't be long before you've gone.
I can't imagine leaving.
It won't be long before you've gone.
I can't imagine leaving.
It won't be long before you've gone.
I can't imagine leaving.
It won't be long before you've gone.
I can't imagine leaving.
And we look out upon the sea.
We look out upon the sea.
The coast is always changing.
I'll bring my camera out to sea.
My heart is always changing.
We'll take the train out to the sea.
My pulse is always racing.
As we look out upon the sea.
The coast is always changing.
And though it saddens me to stay.
I'm still waiting for that day.
1 in a million.
2 is a crowd.
3 is company.
4's not allowed.
I spent all night trying to remember your address.
Drawing lines around your body.
Making marks on the mucky floor.
5 little fingers.
6 digit fix.
My lucky 7.
There are 8 steps to my hips.
I spent all night trying to remember your address.
Drawing lines around your body.
Making marks on the mucky floor.
Why did we have to meet on the night I lost my head?
Why did we have to meet on the night I lost my head?
1 in a million.

I spent all night trying to remember your address.
Drawing lines around your body.
Making marks on the mucky floor.
Why did we have to meet on the night I lost my head?
Why did we have to meet on the night I lost my head?
You found me indiscreet on the night I lost my head.
You found me in the street on the night I lost my head.
Cut away and hard to find.
I don't remember why I started speaking.
Fast-track operation.
Slow exertion over ridden.
Unseen tough to catch.
I can't remember why I started drinking.
One-track mind each and every time.
Smooth insertion country living.
Engage and then entrust.
I can't remember when I started hurting.
Another streetlight going down.
The night reveals itself to you.
Slipping under sliding down.
All I need is a certain trigger.
The path you take will never make you happy.
All I need is a certain spur.
Once a glimpse was all I needed.
I can't remember why I have to give you back.
I just remember that I kept all of your souvenirs.
Salvaged traces of a love I never had.
Enforced and then enabled.
I don't remember why I started breathing.
Tied up turn him loose.
Slow desertion kept me hidden.
That's that no escaping.
I can't remember why I started thinking.
Wrapped up cutting back.
Their inertia left you driven.
Once a glimpse was all I needed.
I can't remember why I have to give you back.
I just remember that I kept all of your souvenirs.
Salvaged traces of a love I never had.
Just a glimpse was all I needed.
I can't remember why I have to give you back.
I just remember that I kept all of your souvenirs.
Salvaged traces of a love I never had.
I wish that I could say I don't need you anymore.
I heard every word you said and that is all.
I wish that I could say I don't need you anymore.
I heard every word you said and that is all.
Just a glimpse was all I needed.
I don't remember why I have to give you back.
I just remember that I kept all of your souvenirs.
Salvaged traces of a love I never had.
I don't think you're gonna get that early bed.
I don't think you're gonna get that early night.
I don't think you're gonna get that early bed.
I don't think you're gonna get it.
Just a glimpse was all I needed.
I don't remember why I have to give you back.
I just remember that I kept all of your souvenirs.
Salvaged traces of a love I never had.
If you're gonna talk about the things I need then you're gonna have to find out what they are.
You remind me of a time when I was boring.
I recall a time when you could slip your noose.
I washed my hands of you.
My feet won't hit the ground.
I often ask myself, when am I gonna learn?
I know you'll be content in the right line of employment.
I never held you, you never hold me.
It's happening all over again.
I tried to tempt you, you say I'm deluded.
When will this foolishness cease?
Every time I see you I start choking.
I prefer to keep my eyes wide open.
Ballerina poses get you nowhere.
Patience is a virtue when you're near me.
I washed my hands of you.
My feet won't hit the ground.
I often ask myself, when am I gonna learn?
I know you'll be content in the right line of employment.
I never held you, you never hold me.
It's happening all over again.
I tried to tempt you, you say I'm deluded.
When will this foolishness cease?
I know that you'll be content in the right line of employment.
I know you'll be fine in the right line.
You'll be fine in the right line.
I know that you'll be fine now that you're not mine.
I never held you, you never hold me.
It's happening all over again.
I tried to tempt you, you say I'm deluded.
When will this foolishness cease?
I attempted to snare you with old-fashioned manners but patience was never my thing.
When I said you were special you know that I meant it.
Now I'm all over the shop.
If you carry on like that you'll never make it.
If you carry on like me you'll never make it.
You'll never make it.
You've got to catch an early plane and it's no surprise I'm standing still.
Another minute more is all I need and I'll never have enough.
This room gets so cold in the winter, what will it take to heat this house?
I just want to feel comfortable.
When there's only the two of us on my bed, my foot nearly brushes your leg.
I can't draw it away; I can't push it forward.
It lies stranded, it belongs to someone else.
We knew each other once. 
this can't be what you want, but you didn't have to demolish me.
I don't remember losing sight of your needs.
I don't remember losing sight of your needs.
I am not an acrobat, I cannot perform these tricks for you.
Losing all my balance, falling from a wire meant for you.
The sky is often used as a metaphor and I suppose that's because it's so big and expansive.
When a long strand of cloud sits just above the horizon leaving a strip of clear blue beneath it.
It becomes the panorama.
It'll turn your head three hundred and sixty degrees and the same line follows you round if the land is sufficiently flat.
Really, nothing can be compared to it.
I don't remember losing sight of your needs.
I don't remember losing sight of your needs.
I am not an acrobat, I cannot perform these tricks for you.
Losing all my balance, falling from a wire meant for you.
I am not an acrobat, I cannot perform these tricks for you.
Losing all my balance, falling from a wire meant for you.
I know the night has reached that stage again where I never want to see my home.
I know that you'll provide the brains but who'll provide the brawn?
And if it comes down to me and him you know I'd kiss you better.
I kept the message that you sent to me.
Bear with me if you're scared.
My beliefs make me bound.
I think it's time we compiled a list of places where we shouldn't go.
Now is not the time to lose your voice.
Everyone should have a choice.
And if you should ever fall you know I'd kiss you better.
I kept the letters that you sent to me.
Close your eyes if you're scared.
My beliefs will make you drown.
You, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?
You, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?
You, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?
You, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?
